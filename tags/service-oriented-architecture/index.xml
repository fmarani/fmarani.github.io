      <description>Service Oriented Architectures as i intend are architectures where each component is deployable and usable separately from others. Take as example Amazon, much of their software stack is offered as a service, mainly through an HTTP interface, and marketed as SaaS.
There are tons of reasons why you would want to think to your system as a series of components deployable separately&amp;hellip; flexibility, being able to choose the right tools for each component, etc.</description>
