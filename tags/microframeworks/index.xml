      <description>The idea of microframeworks is an interesting new idea which appeared over the internet quite recently. The number of web frameworks available on internet is massive and many times i found myself puzzled about which one is the best one to use. Of course there are the ones i believe are the &amp;ldquo;classics&amp;rdquo; (django and ruby on rails) plus many minor ones. The first famous microframework was Sinatra, followed now by others.</description>
