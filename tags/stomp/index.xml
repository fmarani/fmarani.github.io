      <description>Lately i have been working on the idea of queues and pubsub mechanisms and how it is possible to integrate them in a microblogging service. I am fascinated by messaging protocols and event pushing!
Let me say that XMPP is in my opinion the protocol of the future, however its pubsub implementation is quite complex if compared to what STOMP offers, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t find any mature PHP library.</description>
