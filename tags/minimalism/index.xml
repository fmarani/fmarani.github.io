      <description>I want to blog about this topic because minimalism, meant as the art of doing only the essential, is a very hard thing to do. Writing about things helps me with having a clear mind. I will therefore try to write about it, and rewrite about it in the future as many times as my thinking clears up.
I realize this article will leave you with a ton of space for interpretation.</description>
