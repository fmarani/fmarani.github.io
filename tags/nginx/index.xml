      <description>One of our most trafficked website is on average sustaining 300000 page views per day. Each page has normally a considerable amount of JavaScript, some of it activated only after the whole DOM has been loaded.
Considering that every page has on average 20-30 images coming from our image server, every small optimization to it has an avalanche effect on all the other parts of the system.
I already described the infrastructure in the Nginx post.</description>

      <description>I have installed Nginx some time ago on one of our busiest servers on our partner&amp;rsquo;s networks, i promised i would have blogged about this and now it&amp;rsquo;s about time. This server only serves images of products sold thorugh our e-commerce site. The first configuration was only a simple web server which was serving already resized images directly, due to the massive amount of images and the cleaning of it which was taking days, i decided to use Nginx in reverse proxy mode.</description>
