      <description>At TrialReach we deal with clinical trials data, which contain a lot of spatial information. Tipically, clinical trials treat a certain set of conditions and they happen in various locations globally. If you are a patient then searching across clinical trials becomes really spatial sensitive: you are only interested in the closest location to you.
This case might apply to other events as well, but the key point is global distribution.</description>
