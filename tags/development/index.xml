      <description>Do what you love is what, for instance, Steve Jobs said. It does not get more true than that. Hacking has been labeled as a negative word, but for me has a positive meaning, which is the impulse of people to open things, learn how they work and change it to make it better. Hacking for me is a passion, something I always do with pleasure.
Having this attitude in IT is important, only experimenting with stuff pushes your skills forward.</description>

      <description>About a year and half ago I started to be interested in Scala. Scala is a hybrid between an Object Oriented language and a Functional Language, and while i was using it i learnt to appreciate more and more the Functional part. I will not hide that the most difficult part in learning Scala was because of that.
The mindset when solving problems using FP is different because it forces you to think in terms of mapping transformations rather than step-by-step algorithms.</description>
