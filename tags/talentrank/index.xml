      <description>A month ago me and my co-founder did an application for YC, and last week we were lucky enough to be selected for an interview, along with other startups. We got called all the way to California with not even a week of notice, everything paid&amp;hellip; definitely a bit more serious than a phone call.
We prepared a lot during the last few days, reading what people say online, meeting previous YC companies, doing mock interviews with YC alumni.</description>
