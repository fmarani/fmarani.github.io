      <description>Security is a difficult topic, the discipline is very &amp;ldquo;deep&amp;rdquo;, therefore it is easy to make mistakes if you do not dig deep enough. Unfortunately many people misjudge perceived security with real security, on the basis of &amp;ldquo;it makes sense&amp;rdquo;.
HTTPS is a wonderful protocol, it gives you encryption therefore you cannot see what is going on at L7 (urls, http headers, http verbs, app data). This level of obscurity may be enough for simple apps.</description>
