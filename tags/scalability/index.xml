      <description>Scalability was one of the primary concerns when we started building the tool. Essentially, the tool gathers numbers about links you post, it is quite straightforward. To gather these numbers, our tool uses many external APIs and in a way acts as a sort of proxy between the user and many other 3rd party API providers, on top of which some internal indicators are derived. Many tools allow you to do that, but, regarding scalability, some ways are better than others.</description>

      <description>There is no secret recipe, there is no list of check boxes to tick&amp;hellip; just some guidelines. Part of these lessons have been learned in the hard way, part because i have been always taught that if you want to be the best, you have to copy the best. There is plenty of literature on Internet about this&amp;hellip; read, understand and copy.
I think the art of building high-traffic websites is part about the code, but mostly about your web architecture and the tools you use.</description>
