      <description>This article is about PHPUnit used in conjunction with DBUnit to test PHP code that interacts with a database server.
Please note that DBUnit is able to load and unload sets of data to the db but does not handle table creation and queries that alter structures. This is responsibility of an ORM or an initial sql script that creates/rebases the initial environment.
Code i wrote is run against a very simple ORM implementation we currently use in my workplace.</description>

      <description>The idea of microframeworks is an interesting new idea which appeared over the internet quite recently. The number of web frameworks available on internet is massive and many times i found myself puzzled about which one is the best one to use. Of course there are the ones i believe are the &amp;ldquo;classics&amp;rdquo; (django and ruby on rails) plus many minor ones. The first famous microframework was Sinatra, followed now by others.</description>
