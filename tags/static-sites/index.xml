      <description>Hugo This site was built using Django and, given the very simple content model that it had (and almost never changed), I decided to rebuild it in Hugo. I also was getting fed up of mantaining yet another dynamic site, along with runtime and databases. I picked Hugo because it is written in Go, therefore very easy to get going (one file to install) and it works on any platform.</description>
