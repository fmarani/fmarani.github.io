      <description>This had quickly become one of my favourite languages. If you see it from the point of view of expressiveness, it is really close to Python. It is quite new in the world of programming languages, but it is mature enough to be used by big players such as Twitter and Foursquare.
What i like of that language is mainly conciseness united with the possibility of using almost every tool and library from the Java world.</description>
