      <description>Single sign on is a very common requirement for organizations with many employees.

Similarly, employee churn becomes an ordinary event, and you have to make sure that people that do not work for the company anymore are taken out from your user database and their accesses revoked.
Before the advent of SSO (or LDAP/AD), users were created and managed on the various systems separately.</description>
