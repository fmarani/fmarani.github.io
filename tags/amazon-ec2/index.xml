      <description>Problem Sometime ago I had to run a statistical software on some data, the computation was really expensive, it was impractical to run it on my small laptop as it would hung for hours waiting for a result to come up. I thought about running it on Amazon.
Solution Amazon EC2 is a virtual machine hosting service, also known as IaaS. Quite similar to Linode or Rackspace. Payment here is per hour, differently from Linode&amp;hellip; slightly on the expensive side i might add, but top-end VMs are quite powerful.</description>
