      <description>About a year and half ago I started to be interested in Scala. Scala is a hybrid between an Object Oriented language and a Functional Language, and while i was using it i learnt to appreciate more and more the Functional part. I will not hide that the most difficult part in learning Scala was because of that.
The mindset when solving problems using FP is different because it forces you to think in terms of mapping transformations rather than step-by-step algorithms.</description>

      <description>This had quickly become one of my favourite languages. If you see it from the point of view of expressiveness, it is really close to Python. It is quite new in the world of programming languages, but it is mature enough to be used by big players such as Twitter and Foursquare.
What i like of that language is mainly conciseness united with the possibility of using almost every tool and library from the Java world.</description>
