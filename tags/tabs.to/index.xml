      <description>Tabs.to was a url shortener, but with a twist, it could support multiple urls and it was displaying them with a sort of tabbed interface which you could use to switch between pages. The use case I was seeing was sending multiple links via twitter, and by doing so you would have saved space. In hindsight, it seems pretty short-sighted but that was the problem I had. This was in 2010, 4 years ago.</description>
