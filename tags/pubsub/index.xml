      <description>Following the last article, i have been experimenting again on laconica and pubsub, this time on the idea of &amp;ldquo;filtering the real time web&amp;rdquo;.
Stomp and generally JMS messages offer the ability to specify headers and body of the message to transmit, in a way that resembles http requests. In fact, Stomp protocol is really similar to Http protocol, at least in the general structure. The difference is that there are different methods instead of GET, POST, etc.</description>

      <description>Lately i have been working on the idea of queues and pubsub mechanisms and how it is possible to integrate them in a microblogging service. I am fascinated by messaging protocols and event pushing!
Let me say that XMPP is in my opinion the protocol of the future, however its pubsub implementation is quite complex if compared to what STOMP offers, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t find any mature PHP library.</description>
