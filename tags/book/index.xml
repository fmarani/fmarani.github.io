      <description>Some notes about the book I read in 2018. These notes are mostly for my future self. Book are presented in order of &amp;ldquo;impact&amp;rdquo;, which is a completely personal metric.
4-hour body week (Tim Ferris) Full of very useful, body-related advice. My biggest takeaway from this is that i experimented for a couple of months the low-carb diet he suggested, and i have never been this slim before. I always wrongly assumed that my weight must be genetic, given how much sport I do.</description>

      <description>This year I had the chance to finally write a book. This took me most of my free time between March and October of this year. Writing this book was very hard: it required discipline and structure. The good thing for me is that I like writing and I like having clarity of mind, and this was an exercise in both.
The book is on Amazon
